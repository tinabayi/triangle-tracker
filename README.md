|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------|----------------|
| When putting equal numbers of sides, the application will  tell you that you make  an Equilateral Triangle                                                                     | 3,3,3 | Equilateral    |
|  When putting two equal numbers of sides,  and one is not equal to others  the application alerts you that you make  an Isosceles Triangle                                     | 4,4,3 | Isosceles      |
| When a user putting three different numbers  of sides the system will pop up that a Triangle you make is Scalene                                                               | 4,5,6 | Scalene        |
| When an user enter three numbers of sides  and the sum of any two sides  of the triangle is equal to or less  than the third remaining side,  then a triangle CANNOT be formed | 9,4,3 | Not a Triangle
